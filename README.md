Root Cellar
==================

"Someone's in my root cellar. Someone with a fresh soul!" -- Henrietta, /Evil Dead/

Whether it be the root cellar, the basement, the garage, or the attic, we all
store things somewhere. If you're like me, you then promptly forget about them.
Now you don't have to!

No matter what you're storing, it can be added to Root Cellar, and it will
track inventory, expiration dates, or anything else you need. Eventually.
